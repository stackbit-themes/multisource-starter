# Stackbit Multi Content Source Demo

This demo shows how Stackbit's visual editor can be used to edit a website
powered by multiple content sources.

In this demo, a Next.js site fetches content from 3 different content sources.

- Contentful
- Sanity
- Airtable 

The website pages are generated from Contentful's `page` content type.
Additionally, the pages have sections with content from all three content sources.

The fetching of the content is done inside the `getStaticPaths` and the
`getStaticProps` Next.js methods using official plugins of each of the
content sources.

## Running locally

To run this demo locally, clone this repo and install dependencies using
`npm install`.
Then create an `.env.local` file with the following environment variables:

```shell
CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=1gxukxz1954v
CONTENTFUL_PREVIEW_TOKEN=tvvh5hDp7zKfK1o9BdSG5yIOj-xtdEsWyAE7ckdk-jA
CONTENTFUL_DELIVERY_TOKEN=tjHLayKIiGepOlmG3tg68BTwp9eYMYA8iUM9H2f28qQ
CONTENTFUL_MANAGEMENT_TOKEN=[PASTE_YOUR_OWN_OTKEN]

SANITY_PROJECT_ID=xlzh5w9l
SANITY_TOKEN=[PASTE_YOUR_OWN_OTKEN]

AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=app0GjmTLOZyfSvZj
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=[PASTE_YOUR_OWN_OTKEN]
```

Then run `npm run dev` and navigate to https://localhost:3000 to see the result.

## Editing content visually with Stackbit

To edit the content visually using Stackbit's local development, open a separate
terminal window and install the Stackbit CLI:

```shell
npm i -g @stackbit/cli@latest
```

Then, while your `next dev` is running in a different terminal, run:

```shell
stackbit dev
```

You will see a log that looks something like:

```shell
info: âš¡ Open https://app.stackbit.com/local/... in your browser
```

Click the link to open Stackbit.

All Stackbit configuration is defined inside the [stackbit.config.js](./stackbit.config.js)
file. When Stackbit reads and writes the content from content sources, it loads
content-source modules from the `stackbit.config.js`. Each content-source module
implements the ContentSourceInterface. The content-source modules do not affect
or interface with the website's code in any way.

Check out the [AirtableContentSource.ts](./airtable-content-source/AirtableContentSource.ts)
file for the example of content-source module implementation.
